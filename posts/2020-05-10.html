                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>There's no denying that Adele's eyeliner has become iconic. The award-winning singer continues to floor beauty addicts everywhere with her flawless cat eye liner look – and now her secret has been revealed. Michael Ashton, the Hello singer's make-up artist, has shared how he creates the style…</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p1.jpg" class="lazyload"><p>The secret to Adele's flawless eyeliner has been revealed</p></p>

                        <p>"Product cocktailing is key to achieving the intensity and opaqueness of the eyeliner," he told The Cut. "I always start by outlining the shape of the liner, working from the inner to outer corner of the eye with a black gel liner.</p>
                        <p>"I then work the product right into the root of the lashes and then build thickness gradually. Once I'm finished creating the desired shape, I use a waterproof liquid liner with a precision tip to intensify and refine the line, finishing by winging the end of the liner last."</p>
                        <p>Michael also admitted that it was because of the eyeliner look that he and Adele formed a strong bond, after he did her make-up before she met up with her friends.</p>
                        <p>"We were introduced through a mutual friend in the summer of 2007 leading up to the release of her first album, 19. I popped over to her house to trim her fringe and she asked if I could do a quick bit of eyeliner for her before she went to meet friends," he explained. "The eyeliner obviously got the seal of approval and the rest, as they say, is history."</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="/img/p2.jpg" class="lazyload">Adele regularly turns heads on the red carpet with her style and beauty</p>
                        <p>Nowadays, Adele continues to dazzle the world not only with her incredible vocals and impressive career, but her down-to-earth personality and striking beauty.</p>
                        <p>"I think her beauty look resonates with people because it’s aspirational but also extremely achievable," mused Michael. "It seems everyone is always wanting to try and wear the latest beauty looks from the runway or the high street and often it just doesn’t translate.</p>
                        <p>"Adele is known for her make-up, but what makes her a modern beauty icon is the strength of keeping things simple and classic so they stand the test of time."</p>
                        <p>Adele has floored her social media followers with a series of striking photos in which she has ditched her trademark winged eyeliner and gone completely make-up free. The notoriously private Hello hitmaker delighted her fans as she gave them a rare glimpse into her life offstage as she enjoyed some rare downtime during her tour.</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="/img/p3.jpg" class="lazyload"><p>Adele wowed fans as she went make-up free in candid snaps</p></p>
                        <p>In the candid black-and-white snaps posted on her Instagram account, the 28-year-old can be seen looking as radiant as ever as she enjoyed the outdoors during her stay in Vancouver, where she performed at the Rogers Arena on Wednesday night.</p>
                        <p>One photo sees the British beauty basking in the sun while sitting outside on a terrace, wearing a stylish maxi dress with sheer lace detailing, her hair swept to the side for ultimate laidback glamour.</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="/img/p4.jpg" class="lazyload"><p>TThe star posted a series of backstage photos on Instagram</p></p>
                        <p>In a separate photo, Adele showed off her sense of humour as she headed backstage at the arena ahead of her performance, donning a security guard jumpsuit and jokingly pouting for the camera, once again showing off her glowing complexion by opting to wear no make-up, and sweeping her hair up into a messy top knot.</p>
                        <p>The Set Fire to the Rain singer also shared a sweet photo of herself visiting Denver in Colorado, lounging in a pool and laughing with friends as she put her head under a waterfall feature.</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="/img/p5.jpg" class="lazyload"><p>Adele also shared a photo from her trip to Denver</p></p>
                        <p>Despite being renowned for her flawless make-up, Adele has previously admitted that she doesn't know how to create her look herself.</p>
                        <p>"I can't actually do my own hair and make-up, which is a first world problem," she told the Daily Star. "But the good thing about it is no one recognises me when I go to the shops or to the park because it doesn't look like me."</p>
                        <p>Explaining that this means she doesn't "need to go out in disguise", Adele quipped that because people fail to recognise her, she has a reputation for being a "hermit".</p>
                        <p>She said: "People think I'm a hermit but it's just because no one recognises me when I go out."</p>
